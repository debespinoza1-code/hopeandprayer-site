  "body": "King Jeroboam feared that if the people kept worshiping in Jerusalem (the Temple in Judah), their loyalty would return to the Davidic line.\nSo he reframed it: “Here is something easier.”\nPackaged as efficiency and accessibility—the two golden calves.\n\nHe didn’t reject God outright.\nHe redefined Him.\nHe assigned to idols what only God had done.\nHe transferred God’s glory to something man-made.\n\nAnytime we credit our rescue, security, or identity to something other than GOD, we replay this moment.\n\nThe northern kingdom never recovered.\nThe ten tribes were lost.\nJeroboam son of Nebat caused Israel to sin—because he institutionalized distortion.\n\nBe wary:\nNot all falsehoods sound hostile.\nNot all errors feel rebellious.\nSome deception sounds reasonable.\n\nAnd notice the phrase “long enough.”\nThat is the language of spiritual fatigue.\nBut faith is not about convenience.\nIt is about covenant—the binding, sacred relationship established by GOD.\n\n\nThe Gospel: \n\nJesus reveals something essential about GOD’s nature.\nHe doesn’t merely observe human need.\nHe enters it.\n\nHe notices the endurance of the four thousand—\nnot just their lack.\nThey chose being near to Him over comfort.\nFaith often looks like staying with Christ\neven when resources are thin.\n\nJesus does not separate body from soul.\nHe feeds them as He teaches them truth.\nHe cares about the whole person.\n\nHis miracles begin with mercy—\nnot power, not spectacle.\nThey are responses to love.\n\nEven when you have little strength left.\nEven when you’ve been “with Him” a long time\nand feel empty.\nChrist’s heart still moves toward you—\nwith pity, with mercy,\nwith intention to provide."
