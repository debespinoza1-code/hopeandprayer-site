  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "Leviticus 19 lays the foundation when God says, “Fear your God. I am the LORD,” and then defines holiness through very concrete acts — honesty, restraint, justice, refusing revenge, loving your neighbor in real ways. It is a call to live as though God is present in the ordinary and watching how you treat the vulnerable. In Matthew 25, Jesus brings that same truth into full light. The final judgment is not framed around religious performance but around whether you fed the hungry, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, visited the sick and imprisoned. And the shock is that people do not realize they were responding to Him. What Leviticus declares in covenant language, Matthew reveals in personal form: the neighbor you are commanded to love is where Christ Himself meets you. Fear of God, then, is not anxiety about punishment; it is living with the steady awareness that your life is before Him — and that how you treat the least is how you respond to the Lord.\n\n\n"
