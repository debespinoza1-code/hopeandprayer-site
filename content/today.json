  "body": "The Penitential Psalms are seven psalms the Church has traditionally grouped together because they give voice to repentance, sorrow for sin, and radical trust in God’s mercy.\nThey are:\nPsalm 6\nPsalm 32\nPsalm 38\nPsalm 51\nPsalm 102\nPsalm 130\nPsalm 143\n\nIf you, O Lord, mark iniquities, who can stand?\nThat line comes from Psalm 130:3-3b, one of the Church’s great penitential prayers: “If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?” \n\nIt is a devastatingly honest sentence. To “mark” is to keep record, to track, to hold against, to count without mercy. The psalmist imagines a God who relates to us through measured judgement—every hidden motive, every sharp word, every prideful thought, every neglected love carefully tallied and preserved. Under that kind of scrutiny, no one survives. Not the religious. Not the disciplined. Not the sincere. No one. And that is precisely the point.\n\nThe next breath answers the fear: “But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.” God’s justice is real, but it is not detached bookkeeping. His mercy is not soft sentiment either. It is covenant mercy. He sees fully—nothing blurred, nothing excused—and still chooses to redeem. \n\nThe psalm is written from the depths, not from confidence or achievement, but from exposure. And yet the writer does not collapse into despair.\nWhy? Because God does not “mark” iniquity the way we mark our own failures. If identity were grounded in flawless performance, none of us would stand—not as teachers or firefighters, not as CEOs or janitors, not as pastors or skeptics, not as mothers or fathers, not as high achievers or quiet strugglers, not as activists or executives, not as students trying to prove themselves or retirees trying to matter. No résumé survives divine audit. No hidden life passes untouched.\n\nStanding before God is not earned stability; it is granted stability. We stand not because the record is clean, but because mercy has the final word.\nSo the real question beneath the psalm is not simply, “Who can stand?” It is whether we are still trying to stand on performance, or whether we are willing to stand on mercy. That shift changes everything.\n\n\n\n"
