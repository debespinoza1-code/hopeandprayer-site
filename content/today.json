  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "In the Gospel of Matthew 6: 7–15, Jesus does something disruptive. He first strips prayer of distraction—no babbling, no piling up phrases, no spiritual theatrics. Then He anchors it: your Father knows what you need before you ask. And only after establishing that foundation, He gives us the Lord’s prayer.\nSo when Jesus gives us the Lord’s Prayer, he is not handing us a way to update God because he needs better, clearer information.  He gives it because we need formation.  The prayer is not a script to impress heaven.  It is a pattern that trains the heart.  That structure does something to you over time. \n\nNotice the order:\nIt begins with who God is.\n“Our Father.”\nBefore daily bread.\nBefore forgiveness.\nBefore deliverance.\nIdentity first.\nRelationship first.\nBelonging first.\nThen come the requests—not as demands, not as bargaining chips, but as trustful speech inside covenant.\nGive us.\nForgive us.\nLead us.\nDeliver us.\nSimple. Honest. Dependent.  So when God gives us a prayer to use, He is not trying to fix our wording.  He is teaching us how to come to Him. Teaching us how children talk to a Father. Not with fear. Not with manipulation. Not with verbosity. But with nearness.\nThe Lord’s Prayer doesn’t exist to make God listen better. It exists to seal us into the truth that we are already claimed; to teach us how to live as those who already know we are heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
