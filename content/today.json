  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "“And your Father who sees what is hidden will repay you”\n\nThat line is quietly radical.\n\nIt shifts the entire center of gravity of faith.\n\nNot toward performance.\nNot toward visibility.\nNot toward being noticed.\n\nBut toward hidden fidelity.\n\nGod is not impressed by what is staged.\nHe is attentive to what is sincere.\n\nThe Father “who sees what is hidden” sees the prayers no one applauds.\nThe endurance no one affirms.\nThe obedience that costs you and benefits no one visibly.\nThe faith that keeps showing up even when it feels unanswered.\n\nWhich means\n\nHe repays in ways deeper than applause.\nOften quieter than we expect.\nOften slower than we want.\nBut always more substantial than what we would have chosen.\n\nIt’s a promise of God’s personal involvement with the unseen parts of your life.\n\nHe sees.\nHe keeps record.\nHe responds.\n\nEven when no one else knows what you are carrying.\n\nEspecially then."
