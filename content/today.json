  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "The first human act after sin is not repentance, not confession, not even prayer. It is self-covering.  The sewing of a loincloth.\n\nWhen Adam and Eve eat of the fruit of knowledge, shame enters consciousness. Awareness turns inward. Not “I did something wrong,” but “something is wrong with me.” That shift changes everything. They immediately try to fix themselves. Improvised. Fragile. “So they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.” They do not ask God. They manufacture a solution. And that becomes the pattern of fallen humanity: perform, hide, control perception, manage exposure. We are still sewing fig leaves. Anything to avoid being vulnerable. Yet later in the same chapter, God makes garments of skin for them. He provides not something fragile or inadequate, but a lasting covering. Human self-justification fails. Divine covering restores.\n\nFig leaves represent self-atonement. God’s garment represents grace. The question quietly presses us: where are you tempted to self-cover rather than allow God to clothe you?\n\nAs the chapter continues, another unsettling line appears: “Then the LORD God said, ‘See! The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, what if he also reaches out his hand to take fruit from the tree of life, and eats of it and lives forever?’” At first glance, it almost sounds as though God is threatened. But what is being revealed is not insecurity. It is protective mercy. This does not mean Adam and Eve became divine. It means they now possess knowledge of evil — not merely awareness that evil exists, but internal participation in it. God’s knowledge is sovereign and whole; human knowledge is fractured and tragic. They did not become godlike in power. They became godlike in burden. They now carry moral consciousness without the capacity to heal themselves.\n\nSo God’s concern is not fear. It is prevention. Living forever in a fallen state would mean eternal alienation, permanent corruption, and never-ending decay of soul and body. Death, paradoxically, becomes a mercy. Not a punishment alone, but a boundary. God is, in effect, saying: I will not allow humanity to freeze itself eternally in brokenness. He bars access to the Tree of Life not to reject humanity, but to prepare for another tree. From this moment, the entire Bible begins to arc toward the Cross. The first tree brought death through disobedience. The second tree brings life through obedience.\n\nEven the phrase “like one of us” carries a deeper resonance. The Church has long heard in it an early whisper of Trinitarian life. God is not solitary. God is relational within Himself. Humanity was created for participation in that life. Sin distorts that participation, but it does not erase the invitation.\n\nGod does not abandon humanity in Eden. He blocks one door so He can open a better one. Eden becomes inaccessible because the conditions for safe communion have been broken. Cherubim and a fiery revolving sword are stationed at the east of the garden, not to declare Eden as off-guard, but to mark it as sacred space — reserved. And it will only be accessed again through Jesus."
