  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "We’re circling something real here. There is tension in these readings. A deep layering that is real and true — old and new.\nIsaiah is exposing false fasting: people afflicting themselves outwardly while continuing to exploit, ignore, and wound others. Then God reframes fasting. It is not self-display, spiritual performance, or self-centered deprivation. It is loosening burdens, feeding the hungry, sheltering those without, and clothing the unclothed. A true fast turns you outward.\nThe healing that flows from this is the consequence, not the aim. Not “I fast so God fixes me,” but “I give myself away in love, and healing follows.”\nIn the Gospel, Jesus answers them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?” Fasting, at its core, expresses longing. Longing for God’s closeness. Longing for what is broken to be made whole. Longing for restoration. It is a bodily prayer — a prayer that says, “I hunger for God’s reign to be fully realized.”\nBut as Jesus is physically present, the very thing fasting points toward is standing right in front of them. He is not saying not to fast. He is saying what you are fasting for is right here. He is locating it.\nAnd soon, as His ascension draws near, there will be the beginning of a new fasting — rooted in the same ancient truth.\n"
