I love and praise your name.  \n\nThe Gospel: \n\n“They sought from Him a sign from heaven to test Him.”\n\nI recognize myself in that line.\n\nNot in rebellion.\nNot in defiance.\nBut in exhaustion.\n\nBecause when life becomes heavy, the heart quietly starts asking:\n\nGod, can You just show me something?\nCan You give me proof that You are still working?\nCan You give me a sign that this is going somewhere?\n\nI don’t think I’m trying to trap God.\nI think I’m trying to survive.\n\nWhen Jesus is asked for a sign, He does not perform on demand.\nHe doesn’t turn God into a spectacle.\nHe doesn’t bend heaven to soothe anxiety in the moment.\n\nInstead, He keeps revealing the same truth in quieter ways:\nthrough His presence,\nthrough His mercy,\nthrough His willingness to remain with people in their need.\n\nIn my own season, I realize I’ve been asking for a sign that everything will be okay.\nA sign that the job will come.\nA sign that finances will stabilize.\nA sign that the pressure will lift.\n\nBut maybe the deeper sign is this:\n\nI’m still praying.\nI’m still turning toward Him.\nI’m still bringing my fear into His presence instead of running from Him.\n\nThat is not nothing.\n\nMaybe faith isn’t built by dramatic proof.\nMaybe it’s built by staying.\n\nStaying when I don’t understand.\nStaying when I don’t see outcomes.\nStaying when hope feels thin.\n\nJesus does not shame those who are tired.\nHe invites them to something stronger than signs: trust.\n\nNot trust because circumstances look good.\nNot trust because answers arrived.\nBut trust because God’s character has not changed.\n\nSo today, I’m learning to pray differently.\n\nNot: “God, prove Yourself.”\nBut: “God, hold me while I don’t see.”\n\nAnd maybe that, too, is a holy kind of faith."
