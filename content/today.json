  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "So much is happening in today’s readings.\n\nJames corrects a dangerous misunderstanding. God does not tempt to destroy. God does not author evil. God does not set traps. Every good and perfect gift is from the Father of lights, which means that when you are in hardship, God has not turned against you.\n\nThen Psalm 94 says, “The LORD will not reject His people, nor abandon His inheritance.” This psalm is written under pressure. It names weakness, stumbling, anxiety, and overwhelming thoughts. And yet it keeps returning to one truth: God’s relationship to His people has not changed.\n\nSo James explains how trials function, and Psalm 94 reassures who God is. Together they say this clearly: your suffering is not evidence of rejection. Your struggle is not proof that you’ve been discarded. You are still His.\n\nIn Mark, Jesus names the real danger: “Watch out. Guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And then He makes them remember. Five loaves, five thousand, twelve baskets left over. Seven loaves, four thousand, seven baskets left over. They gathered the baskets. They saw there was more than enough.\n\nTwelve points to Israel, the covenant people — Jesus revealing Himself as their true Shepherd and provider. Seven points to fullness and universality. This second miracle happens in a largely Gentile region. Provision not limited. Mercy not restricted—complete provision for the nations.\n\nSo when Jesus presses them — why do you still not understand? — the issue isn’t bread. It’s forgetting.\n\nLeaven works quietly, internally. Pharisee leaven says, I must earn God’s help. Herod’s leaven says, I must secure control. Different expressions. Same disease. Both form when hardship is read as God being absent.\n\nBut Jesus keeps pointing back to one simple truth: I already showed you who provides.\n\nLeaven says, provide for yourself. Jesus says, remember who fed you. Any spirituality that replaces childlike trust with control or calculation is leaven.\n\nGod is faithful. God is present. God provides. That is unleavened bread."
