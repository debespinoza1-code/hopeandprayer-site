  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "Yes, Levi is Matthew. The Church preserves both names to show that Jesus does not erase your past. He redeems it and repurposes it.\n\nUnder the Mosaic covenant, Sabbath was a legal command and a sign of Israel’s relationship with God. The early Church did not continue Saturday Sabbath observance as binding law. Christians gathered on Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, and Sunday became the Lord’s Day. The moral heart of Sabbath remained, but its fulfillment shifted into Christ: worship, rest, and re-centering life on God.\n\nIsaiah 58 reveals what God has always been after. Not religious technique. Not performance. But orientation. God confronts people who are fasting and practicing religion while still living inward, still organizing their lives around themselves. Then He reframes true devotion: turn outward in mercy: loosen burdens, feed the hungry, shelter the poor, stop pointing fingers. Only after that does God speak about the Sabbath. “Hold back your foot,” meaning stop trampling what belongs to God. “Call the Sabbath a delight,” meaning stop treating God as an interruption. The deeper command is simple: do not live seven days as if everything revolves around your productivity. Let worship reorder your week.\n\nThis is exactly what happens with Levi.\n\nJesus does not ask Levi to explain himself or clean up his life. Jesus simply says, “Follow me.” Levi stands up. Conversion begins as movement, not moral perfection. He leaves an old identity, an old source of security, and an old way of defining his worth. His first act is not private spiritual intensity. He throws a banquet. He opens his house. He invites people like himself. Jesus eats with them. In that world, table fellowship meant recognition. By reclining at table, Jesus is declaring that these people belong in His presence before they have it together.\n\nReligion says clean, then belong. Jesus shows belong, therefore, transformation begins.\nIsaiah 58 and Levi’s call are telling the same story. First mercy, then rest. Sabbath is not presented as a sterile rule but as the fruit of reordered desire. When life stops revolving around self-preservation and starts revolving around love, rest becomes possible. That is why fasting, Sabbath, and following Jesus all aim at the same question: who or what organizes your life? If fear, money, or control sits at the center, rest will always feel impossible. Sabbath becomes possible only when God begins to reorganize the center.\n\nGod is not asking for mastery or spiritual heroics. He is asking for trust. If Sunday looks identical to Tuesday, something is off. But every small attempt to guard worship, choose mercy, and keep walking counts. Not flawlessly. Faithfully.\n"
