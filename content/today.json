  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "“For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.”\n\nGod's Spirit is not limited to surface knowledge. The Spirit knows God's inner life—His intentions, wisdom, will, and purpose. Because believers receive the Spirit, we are invited into truths that human reasoning alone cannot access. Divine reality is revealed, not discovered by man’s intelligence alone.\n\nYou don't figure out God like solving a problem. You come to know God because God chooses to disclose Himself through His Spirit. The nuance of spiritual maturity is deeper surrender and attentiveness to the Spirit who already knows the depths of God. So if the Spirit searches the depths of God and lives within you, then your faith is not shallow by design. You are wired for deep communion and revelation.\n\nNow the readings from Sirach state, “If you choose, you can keep the commandments.” God places before man life and death. Human freedom is real; grace does not erase responsibility. God does not force sin or make obedience impossible. It is a choice. The Spirit reveals what God desires. Sirach says you must choose it—revelation and freedom.\n\nThe Psalmist asks for discernment that I may observe your law and keep it with all my heart, asking for illumination. The Spirit opens eyes to the depths of God's law. The law is not just rule; it contains God's interior wisdom. Without His Spirit, the law feels heavy; with His Spirit, it becomes luminous.\n\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is revealing the depths of the law. The Spirit searches the depths of God. Jesus reveals the depths of the commandments. The commandments were never merely about external behavior; they have always been about interior transformation."
