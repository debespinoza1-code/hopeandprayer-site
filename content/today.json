  "body": "Esther is the Jewish queen in the Old Testament Book of Esther. She lived during the reign of Xerxes I, ruler of the Persian Empire from 486–465 BC — an empire that stretched across what is now Iraq, Israel, Egypt, parts of Turkey, and Greece. She was the daughter of Abihail, from the tribe of Benjamin. Her Hebrew name was Hadassah. Orphaned young, she was raised by her Jewish cousin Mordecai.\n\nThrough a royal selection process in the Persian capital of Susa, she became queen — yet she initially kept her Jewish identity hidden.\n\nThen history tightened.\n\nA high official named Haman manipulated the king into signing a decree ordering the destruction of all the Jews in the empire. An attempted genocide. If that decree had succeeded, the covenant line — the people through whom the Messiah would come — would have been erased.\n\nMordecai urged Esther to intervene. This is where the defining line appears:\n\n“Who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”\n\nShe had position. But she had to choose courage.\n\nApproaching the king without being summoned could mean immediate death. There was no guarantee of favor. No visible miracle. No audible voice from heaven. She fasted. She prayed. And she went anyway.\n\nShe exposed Haman’s plot. The decree was reversed. Haman was executed. The Jewish people were preserved.\n\nEsther is the only book in Scripture where God’s name is never explicitly mentioned — yet His providence is shown in every chapter.  No evidence of prophetic thunder. Strategic obedience. Courage at the decisive moment. Remember Esther takes place when Israel is scattered inside a foreign empire. There is no Davidic king. No prophet publicly speaking.  No temple.\n\nHer story sits within a larger timeline. In Egypt, Pharaoh sought to destroy the Hebrews. In Exodus, Moses was raised inside the royal court and returned with signs and spectacles to lead the liberation. Later came the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, then the Babylonian exile in 586 BC, when Jerusalem was destroyed. Babylon was conquered by Persia. During this Persian period, the Jewish people were scattered throughout the empire.\n\nIn Exodus, annihilation is threatened — and God preserves His people.\nIn Esther, annihilation is threatened — and again, God preserves His people.\n\nBut with Esther, there is silence.\n\nNo burning bush.\nNo plagues.\nNo parted sea.\n\nJust circumstance, pressure, timing, and a decision.\n\nShe did not seek influence. She was placed in it. She did not wake up knowing her destiny. She discovered it under threat. That is providence — ordinary positioning over years, skills acquired unintentionally, relationships formed quietly, doors opening without dramatic explanation. Then comes a moment of convergence.\n\nGod's providence arranges without coercing. It respects freedom. It feels less like supernatural display and more like weight — a heaviness that stepping back would be a betrayal of something sacred.\n\nWhen Esther approached the king, she could have been slain on the spot. That is obedience without guarantee.\n\nAnd this is why I talk about her.\n\nBecause God does not usually tell you, “You are Esther.”\n\nHe allows you to live.\nTo develop.\nTo endure.\nTo struggle.\nTo be shaped.\n\nIf you knew the whole plan in advance, pride would devour it. Instead, it comes as an invitation. A choice. A decisive moment that reveals who you have become.\n\nEsther shows that even when there is no visible king in Israel, no temple center, no prophet speaking publicly, God is still governing history.\n\nQuietly.\n\nAnd when the moment comes, He waits for a response."
