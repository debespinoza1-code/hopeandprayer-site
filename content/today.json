  "opening": "Lord, meet us gently today and always",
  "prayer": "Jesus, I trust in You.",
  "body": "As Moses said to the people:\n\n“The LORD, your God, will bless you in the land you are entering to occupy.”\nAnd also, “You will not have a long life on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and occupy.”\n\nFrom the beginning, this was not just about land. It was about relationship.\n\n“The blessings and the curse” describe a relational reality. They show what life looks like when God’s people walk in covenant fidelity — and what life begins to unravel into when that relationship is refused.\n\nIsrael stood between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal — blessing on one side, curse on the other. Not symbolic in theory. A lived proclamation.\n\nBlessing is the fruit of alignment with God’s will. Not perfection. Not ease. But ordered life. Stability in family, work, and community. Fruitfulness. Provision. Protection. Continuity. Life functioning the way it was designed to function under God’s authority. It is the natural outflow of living within His design.\n\nThe curse is not cruelty. It is consequence. It is what happens when alignment is severed. Relationships fracture. Work grows heavy. Provision becomes uncertain. Fear replaces trust. Life collapses inward when detached from its source.\n\nHuman freedom is real. But freedom always moves somewhere — toward life or toward decay.\n\nWhen Moses said, “In the land you are entering to occupy,” he meant more than territory. They were stepping into a life meant to be lived under God’s rule. And when he warned, “You will not have a long life on the land…” he was stating a principle: sustained life depends on sustained alignment.\n\nShortly after crossing the Jordan under Joshua, they gathered in the valley between those two mountains. Half facing Gerizim. Half facing Ebal. The Ark at the center. Blessing and curse spoken aloud. Life and death placed before them.\n\nAnd yet — on Mount Ebal, the mountain associated with curse, Joshua built an altar at God’s command. Before obedience could fail, mercy was already present. Before consequence, sacrifice. Because blessing is not reserved for the flawless. It is offered to the repentant.\n\nChrist ransomed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — “cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree” (Gal 3:13). The deepest curse, separation from God, is broken. The greatest blessing, restored communion, is reopened. Union with Him.\n\nBlessing is not a switch God flips. It is a path you walk. Every step toward Him is a step toward life."
